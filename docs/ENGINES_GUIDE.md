## 🔢 Token and Memory Differences

| Feature                | **GPT-4 (o3)**       | **GPT-4o**                  |
|------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| **Max context length** | 128k tokens          | 128k tokens                 |
| **Context handling**   | Stable for large projects and rules | Fast and efficient for shorter interactions |
| **Streaming speed**    | Slower               | ⚡ Extremely fast           |

## 🧠 Reasoning and Code Quality

| Trait                        | **GPT-4 (o3)**                           | **GPT-4o**                                      |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Reasoning stability**     | ✅ Strong and methodical                 | ⚠️ Faster, but may take shortcuts              |
| **Multi-step instructions** | ✅ Follows steps carefully               | ⚠️ Sometimes drops or compresses instructions  |
| **Code generation**         | ✅ Verbose and cautious                  | ⚠️ More concise, sometimes aggressive          |
| **Debugging**               | ✅ Strong contextual memory              | ⚠️ Less accurate with context over time        |
| **Error handling**          | ✅ Better at tracing root cause          | ⚠️ Can gloss over edge cases                   |

## 🛠️ When to Use Which Engine

| Use Case                                   | Best Engine |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 🔧 Critical system feature development      | **GPT-4 (o3)** |
| 🧪 Rapid experimentation or debugging       | **GPT-4o** |
| 📚 Summarizing long logs or documents       | **GPT-4 (o3)** |
| 💬 Chat-like UX, brainstorming, rewriting   | **GPT-4o** |
| 🧩 Multi-file refactor with strict scope    | **GPT-4 (o3)** |
| 🪛 Patch generation with safety checks       | **GPT-4 (o3)** |

## 🧪 Internal Auto-Switching Between Engines?

**No, there is no automatic engine switching based on task rules.**  
You, the user, must select which engine to use (e.g. GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-3.5) when starting a thread.

However, you can **simulate engine-specific behavior** by:
- Keeping different threads for different engines
- Using markdown rule files (`CARDINAL_DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md`) to guide GPT behavior
- Requesting engine-conforming output (e.g. *“write this with o3‑style minimalism”*)

## 🔚 Summary

| Capability           | GPT-4 (o3)       | GPT-4o             |
|---------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Strict rule-following | ✅ Best         | ⚠️ Sometimes fuzzy |
| Fast & interactive   | ⚠️ Slower       | ✅ Best-in-class    |
| Code patch accuracy  | ✅ High          | ⚠️ May over-edit    |
| Memory retention     | ✅ Deep chains   | ⚠️ Shallow bursts   |

Use GPT-4o for speed and UI polish, and GPT-4 (o3) for engineering that must be correct and controlled.
